关于数据隐私保护问题的分析由来已久且涉及多个学科。随着个人电子数据变得越来越详细，并且伴随着技术使数据的收集和管理能力变得越来越强大，对于鲁棒、有意义且数学上严格定义的隐私以及满足此要求的计算丰富的一类算法的需求不断增长。 差分隐私就是这样的定义。

The problem of privacy-preserving data analysis has a long history spanning multiple disciplines. As electronic data about individuals become increasingly detailed, and as technology enables ever more powerful collection and curation of these data, the need increases for a robust, meaningful, and mathematically rigorous definition of privacy, together with a computationally rich class of algorithms that satisfy this definition. Differential Privacy is such a definition.
