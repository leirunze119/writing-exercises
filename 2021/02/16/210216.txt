联邦学习近期成为了机器学习模型训练的重要设定。在联邦设定中，训练数据分布在大量边缘设备上，例如消费类智能手机、个人计算机或智能家用设备。这些设备的数据可用于训练多种模型：文本预测、语音建模、面部识别、文档识别和其他任务。但是，出于数据隐私、责任及法规方面的考虑，这些数据可能难以移至云端进行训练。即使没有这些考虑，在云端训练机器学习模型也可能是昂贵的，而一种有效的在边缘训练相同模型的方法可能消除这一花费。

Federated learning has recently emerged as an important setting for training machine learning models. In the federated setting, training data is distributed across a large number of edge devices, such as consumer smartphones, personal computers, or smart home devices. These devices have data that is useful for training a variety of models – for text prediction, speech modeling, facial recognition, document identification, and other tasks. However, data privacy, liability, or regulatory concerns may make it difficult to move this data to the cloud for training. Even without these concerns, training machine learning models in the cloud can be expensive, and an effective way to train the same models on the edge has the potential to eliminate this expense.
