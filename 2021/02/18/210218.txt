基数估计在理论和应用方面都已有大量的研究。经典的Flajolet-Martin Sketch的变体是理论最优的，实现了已知方法中最佳的经验空间-准确性折中方案。基数估计算法的准确性通常由其乘积误差来衡量。具有已知最佳理论界的算法估计不同计数的真值的乘积因子上限为…，需要…的空间，其中…是抽取的数据元素全集的大小（或者是一个简单的流长度上界）。

There has been a tremendous amount of work both on the theoretical front and on the applied front on cardinality estimation. Variants of the classic Flajolet-Martin sketch are theoretically optimal and achieve the best known empirical space-accuracy trade-offs. The accuracy of cardinality estimation algorithms is typically measured by their multiplicative error. The algorithm with the best known theoretical bound estimates the true distinct count up to a multiplicative factor of …, with space …, where … is the size of the universe from which data elements are drawn (or simply an upper bound on the stream length).
