数据流中的不同元素计数（又称为基数估计）是流计算中的基本问题之一。最简单的算法就是跟踪流中不同元素的集合。这要求的空间随着集合的基数线性增长，因此无法部署在大规模数据上。例如，若想要计算google.com上不同搜索查询的数量，或者点击广告活动的独立用户数量。对于这种庞大的数据流，人们希望使用很少的额外空间——或许只有几千字节，来近似计算不同元素计数。除Web应用程序外，计算不同元素也是许多其他领域的重要组成部分，例如计算生物学、图分析、查询优化、数据挖掘和网络流量监视。

Counting distinct elements in a data stream (a.k.a. cardinality estimation) is one of the fundamental problems in streaming computation. The simplest algorithm would just keep track of the set of distinct elements in the stream. This requires space that grows linearly with the set’s cardinality, making it infeasible to be deployed at scale. For example, one might want to count the number of distinct search queries on google.com, or the number of unique users who clicked on an advertisement campaign. For such large streams, one would like to count distinct elements approximately using a very small amount of additional space—perhaps just a few kilobytes. Beyond web applications, counting distinct elements is an essential component in many other fields, such as computational biology, graph analysis, query optimization, datamining and network traffic monitoring.
