本文提出了两种随机机制，用于用户拥有一组物品且关注在隐私方式下寻找与其他用户的Jaccard相似性的情形。所提出的算法是建立在论文…的基础之上的，本文末尾的相关工作部分将对这种关系进行准确的说明。简而言之，每个用户都首先应用…引入的MinHash以及…的范围压缩来生成其数据的sketch。众所周知，这些草图可用于高效地估计原始Jaccard相似度。现在，每个用户将本地随机化应用于他们的sketch，以满足下一节介绍的差分隐私的概念。

This paper proposes two randomized mechanisms when users have a collection of items and are interested in finding their similarity with other users under the Jaccard similarity in a private manner. The proposed algorithms build upon the papers … and a precise account of the relation will be given in the related work section at the end of this paper. In a nutshell, each user starts by applying MinHash as introduced by … with the range compression of … to produce a sketch of their data. It is well known that these sketches can be used to efficiently estimate the original Jaccard similarity. Now, each user applies a local randomization to their sketch to satisfy the notion of differential privacy as introduced in the next section.
